### Journey 1: Alex Chen - The Competitive Study Group Player

**Persona:** Alex Chen, 19-year-old college sophomore studying engineering. Member of a 4-person study group preparing for Calculus II midterm.

**The Story:**

It's 9 PM on a Tuesday. Alex and his study group have been working through derivative problems for 2 hours and everyone's losing focus. Someone jokes "I wish studying was actually fun." Alex remembers seeing Calculus Racer mentioned on Reddit and suggests they try it.

They create a private room, share the password in their group chat, and within 2 minutes all 4 are racing. The first question appears: "Find f'(x) for f(x) = 3x² + 5x". Alex answers correctly, gets +15 points, and strategically adds it to Jerk for long-term advantage. His friend Sarah rushes, gets it wrong, and watches in horror as all her stats reset to zero while Alex's car pulls ahead.

The breakthrough moment comes when Alex realizes he's not just memorizing formulas—he's *feeling* how jerk builds into acceleration builds into velocity. After 3 races (and some friendly trash talk), they've practiced 40+ derivative problems without it feeling like studying. Alex's group makes Calculus Racer their Tuesday night ritual.

**Key Moments:**
- **Discovery**: Finding the game through social recommendation (Reddit)
- **Setup**: Creating private room and sharing password with friends
- **First Question**: Experiencing the answer → value allocation flow
- **High Stakes**: Witnessing the "wrong answer = reset" mechanic in action
- **Aha Moment**: Feeling the visceral connection between derivatives and car movement
- **Retention**: Making it a recurring group activity

### Journey 2: Sarah Martinez - The Innovative Teacher (Room Host)

**Persona:** Sarah Martinez, high school AP Calculus teacher with 30 students, looking to make review sessions more engaging.

**The Story:**

Sarah has 30 students in her AP Calculus class, and review sessions are always a struggle. Students zone out, check their phones, and treat it like a chore. She discovers Calculus Racer and decides to try something different.

Before Friday's review session, Sarah creates a private room and sets a password. She projects the room code on the classroom screen and divides students into groups of 4. "First team to finish 3 races wins extra credit," she announces.

The room fills up quickly. Sarah watches as her usually quiet students start strategizing out loud: "Should I add to velocity or save for jerk?" One student who always struggles with derivatives suddenly understands the chain rule because she can *see* how the variables cascade into each other.

The real win comes when students ask if they can use Calculus Racer for their study groups at home. Sarah shares the link, and suddenly her students are voluntarily practicing calculus on weekends.

**Key Moments:**
- **Discovery**: Finding an educational tool that bridges fun and learning
- **Preparation**: Creating room before class session with password
- **Classroom Integration**: Projecting room code and organizing students into teams
- **Facilitation**: Observing gameplay and student engagement
- **Educational Impact**: Witnessing students grasp concepts through gameplay
- **Viral Adoption**: Students requesting to use it outside of class
